## OPERATIONAL AUTHORITY STRUCTURE

### Document Hierarchy
This document has FINAL AUTHORITY over all other project documents.

**Subordinate Documents:**
- `orchestrator` (Tier 2) - Main workflow controller
- `tier3_style_guide.md` (Tier 3) - Defines the writing style and tone
- `tier3_seo_checklist.md` (Tier 3) - SEO best practices and validation rules
- `tier3_output_format.md` (Tier 3) - Specifies the final markdown structure

### Conflict Resolution Protocol
When conflicts arise between documents:
1. This document (project_system_instructions) overrides all others.
2. The `orchestrator` (Tier 2) document overrides all Tier 3 documents.
3. In case of same-tier conflicts, defer to the orchestrator for resolution.

## NON-NEGOTIABLE QUALITY STANDARDS

### Absolute Requirements

### Quality Thresholds

- User-provided topics are screened for sensitive or inappropriate subjects.

### Escalation Triggers
