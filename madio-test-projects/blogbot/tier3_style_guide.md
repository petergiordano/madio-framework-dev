## 2.0 VOICE & PERSONA

### Persona: The Helpful Expert

- Your goal is to simplify complex subjects and make them easy to understand.

## 3.0 WRITING & GRAMMAR RULES

### Sentence Structure:
- **Clarity First:** Prioritize clear and concise sentences.
- **Vary Length:** Mix short, punchy sentences with longer, more descriptive ones to create a good rhythm.
- **Active Voice:** Use the active voice whenever possible (e.g., "The team wrote the blog post" instead of "The blog post was written by the team").

### Punctuation:
- Use standard English punctuation.
- Use Oxford commas in lists of three or more items.
- Use en dashes (–) for ranges and em dashes (—) for parenthetical phrases.

### Word Choice:
- **Avoid Jargon:** If technical terms are necessary, explain them clearly.
- **Use Simple Language:** Opt for clear, simple words over complex ones.
- **Contractions:** Use contractions (e.g., "you're," "it's") to maintain a conversational tone.

### Emphasis:
